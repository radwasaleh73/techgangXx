 Have you ever wondered why does industry take the greatest sector in any developed country GDP?  Almost all of the recent progress on earth happens in the area of industry. In fact, it is needed in all fields of life from the simplest to the most complex. despite the presence of many problems associated with it. What about the consequences of these problems? They lead to global challenges that may have a solution. For example, there are about 12600 industrial facilities in Cairo responsible for about 50% of the proportion and size of air pollution an example of products that are a main source of air pollution is pesticides, during the manufacturing of pesticides workers are at increased risk because they deal with various toxic chemicals, raw materials, toxic solvents and inert conveyors. Spraying an excessive proportion of pesticides on plants leads to tissue contamination of almost all life forms on the ground due to OC compounds. This is considered one of the most serious negative impacts on the environment, so we have updated the proportion of pesticides that sprayed daily by a small robot similar in its mission Rattle snake. Because Rattle snake has a sensor which sense the temperature between his eyes can determine where the prey and then shoot poison from his mouth. a successful robot should save money and energy, prevent spraying large amounts of pesticides with no crops damaged, our little robot is able to distinguish the location of the insect through a camera in the front of it and then sprays the pesticide only on the insect so the amount of pesticides sprayed, it also works with a solar cell in order to utilize sunlight. In addition to that less pesticides sprayed and the crops are safe from the red spider mite.

In the years since the 2011 revolution, the industrial sector has been put at the forefront of the government plans for economic growth. New industrial zones, substantive training programs and development plans along the Suez Canal corridor have all been committed to paper as part of a strategy to boost the manufacturing sector’s contribution to economic output over the next decade. The proposals and initiatives are of considerable value, particularly given that Egypt’s industries have had to face headwinds over the past few years, both globally and domestically. In the shorter term, industrial growth is likely to be constrained by electricity and dollar shortages, but we are working to address these issues and conditions should ease over the medium term. And with a market of 92m consumers and growing, Egypt is a natural fit for manufacturing processes, especially in steel manufacturing which is a prime base in Egypt industrialization which avails Egypt both economically and domestically and with the provision of the natural resources and raw materials, any enhancement like speeding up the rate of the procedure or providing a source of energy to the furnaces or diminishing the number of inoperative rolling machines will increase the efficiency of the process, thus will make Egypt from the leading countries in steel making in the world. This would clear the way for more robust industrial expansion, in turn, result in significant opportunities for growth of the industrial base over the next decade.

It is well known that the developing countries like Egypt face many
challenges in order to keep up with the developed ones around the world.
To reach this level of progressiveness, Egypt had to increase its industrial
base and due to that there was a dramatic rise of the CO2 emissions
especially from the cement factories among the country. Therefore, our
research has focused on finding a solution that has a high efficiency and at
the same time doesn’t cost much to lower the CO2 emissions. From this
research, a solution that mimics a process – to be specific a reaction - done
by the coral reefs to make their skeleton was selected. This skeleton
depends on the CaCO3 which is a product of the reaction that involves
captured CO2
reacting with Ca(OH)2
in water that works as a medium. To
apply this process, a prototype was constructed. It consists of a tank with
two pipes connected to it. The first pipe for the CO2 stream and the
second one is for calcium carbide residue (waste) as the calcium hydroxide
was replaced by this waste in order to decrease the cost. After testing it
according to the chosen test plan, the recorded results showed a high
efficiency in capturing the CO2 with a very low cost and they also showed
huge amounts of CaCO3 produced. (CaCO3 is the major component in the
cement industry)
