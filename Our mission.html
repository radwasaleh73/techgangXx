  <h1> Our mission </h1>
<p class="paragraph"> Waking up early, attending school, having lunch, searching, thinking, testing, meeting, searching, searching,
  testing, failing, starting all over again, discussing with teammates, getting 4 hours asleep, your ideas are rejected, feeling miserable, searching, testing and so on until your idea finally works
  This is a normal everyday scenario in any stemer's life, but at the end what we get?
  Straight A's, that is marvellous ,but what else? Some ideas are a real life changing, they just can not be forgotten
  and fade away like that.Thank lord we are here to bring your ideas back to life and show the public how mind blowing your work is,
  and if you are lucky enough, you may even get a sponser to fund your project. Cheer up and have faith!!
